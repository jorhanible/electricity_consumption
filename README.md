## Comments
Comments regarding design choices, decisions, or anything at all.
1) adding + 0.0001 to variable total cost
2) it will take about five minutes for SARIMAX to run
3) had to simulate spot prices
4) SARIMAX provides poor estimation of values
5) if we did that, we would need more data to forecast forbruk for future
6) 
7) + we would need to use external APIs to access data on how forbruk changes between seasons
